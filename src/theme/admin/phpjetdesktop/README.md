# PHPJet Admin Desktop
This is custom theme made for default [PHPJet Administrator Panel](https://phpjet.com/admin/themes). 
## Installation
To modify source code you have to install all dependences:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install
```
## Configure
Don't forget to configure webpack.config.js. The default output directory is set to dist/theme/admin/phpjetdesktop. All JavaScript code compiles to a single file Desktop.js, all SCSS code compiles into single CSS file Desktop.css.

## Launch in the development mode
After configuring everything you can enter development mode.
```bash
# Using npm
npm run watch:dev
```
## Contribute
Since **PHPJet** is the open source application, feel free to make your own changes into project.  
Enjoy!
